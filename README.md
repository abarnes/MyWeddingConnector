MyWeddingConnector (previously myweddingconnector.com) is a lead generation platform for the wedding industry, initially launched in Dallas, TX. Online ads would drive soon-to-be-married people to this site, where we collected their contact information in return for putting them in touch with wedding vendors. We found vendors in many different categories such as florists, musicians, and photographers. The vendors pay on a per-lead basis.

The company was sold in 2012, and the website is no longer live, or it has moved to a new domain.
